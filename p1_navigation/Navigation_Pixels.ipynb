In this notebook, you will learn how to control an agent in a more challenging environment, where it can learn directly from raw pixels!  **Note that this exercise is optional!**\n\n### 1. Start the Environment\n\nWe begin by importing some necessary packages.  If the code cell below returns an error, please revisit the project instructions to double-check that you have installed [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).","metadata":{"cell_id":"00285bc5-14ea-4b3e-b300-d34b87447e92"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"9810fe3f-b378-4dcc-9d4e-c1e80fd4f241"},"source":"from unityagents import UnityEnvironment\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we will start the environment!  **_Before running the code cell below_**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.\n\n- **Mac**: `\"path/to/VisualBanana.app\"`\n- **Windows** (x86): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Windows_x86/Banana.exe\"`\n- **Windows** (x86_64): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe\"`\n- **Linux** (x86): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Linux/Banana.x86\"`\n- **Linux** (x86_64): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Linux/Banana.x86_64\"`\n- **Linux** (x86, headless): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86\"`\n- **Linux** (x86_64, headless): `\"path/to/VisualBanana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86_64\"`\n\nFor instance, if you are using a Mac, then you downloaded `VisualBanana.app`.

A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  \n\nOf course, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!","metadata":{"cell_id":"94ea7957-b447-4117-8a40-110eaa8d6383"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"4aed0ff4-335b-413d-a535-6aa74f43a0da"},"source":"env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name] # reset the environment\nstate = env_info.visual_observations[0]            # get the current state\nscore = 0                                          # initialize the score\nwhile True:\n    action = np.random.randint(action_size)        # select an action\n    env_info = env.step(action)[brain_name]        # send the action to the environment\n    next_state = env_info.visual_observations[0]   # get the next state\n    reward = env_info.rewards[0]                   # get the reward\n    done = env_info.local_done[0]                  # see if episode has finished\n    score += reward                                # update the score\n    state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step\n    if done:                                       # exit loop if episode finished\n        break\n    \nprint(\"Score: {}\".format(score))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When finished, you can close the environment.","metadata":{"cell_id":"58981afb-6db6-467f-8b43-45bf7850929a"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"1f896da5-bee5-4d32-a635-ba1e31c6a9b8"},"source":"env.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.

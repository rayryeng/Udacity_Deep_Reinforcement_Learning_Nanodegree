Examine the State and Action Spaces\n\nIn this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of `+0.1` is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.\n\nThe observation space consists of `33` variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm.  Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.

Examine the State and Action Spaces\n\nIn this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.\n\nThe observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket.
